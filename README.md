# PR-SMI Inductive Strip Position System â€“ STM32 Firmware

This repository contains the STM32 firmware for interfacing with the PR-SMI inductive strip position measurement system.

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop firmware that:

- Generates the necessary excitation waveform for the PR-SMI system.
- Receives and processes the output signal to determine the lateral position of metal strips.
- Integrates with other system components for real-time position monitoring and control.

## Hardware Components

- **Microcontroller**: STM32 series (specific model to be determined).
- **Position Measurement System**: PR-SMI inductive strip position system.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ Project initialization phase. No functional code has been implemented yet.
